# Enterprise Technology Risk Dashboard — Demo

A single-page executive dashboard built from scratch in pure HTML and CSS, designed to replicate the kind of reporting artefact a Technology Risk or GRC function would present to senior leadership or a Board committee.

## What it demonstrates

### Domain knowledge — Technology Risk & GRC
The content is drawn from real-world enterprise risk management practice:

- **Risk Appetite Alignment** — RAG-rated assessment of risk exposure against Board-approved appetite statements across six domains (Cybersecurity, Third-Party, Cloud, AI, Operational Resilience, Data Governance)
- **Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)** — metric-level thresholds with trend indicators and breach status, mirroring how a risk function tracks leading indicators
- **Control Effectiveness** — segmented bar visualisation of control testing results across IAM, Change Management, and Backup & Recovery domains
- **Issues & Audit Management** — open issue register with severity classification, ownership, and overdue tracking
- **Third-Party Risk** — vendor portfolio stats and highlighted exceptions requiring management attention
- **Emerging Risk (AI & Technology)** — AI use case governance metrics and a narrative risk assessment referencing PIPEDA, OSFI Guideline E-23, and model risk considerations

This reflects hands-on familiarity with how technology risk is communicated in regulated financial services environments (insurance, banking).

### Front-end craft — no frameworks, no dependencies
The dashboard is intentionally built without any JavaScript libraries, CSS frameworks, or build tools — just a single `index.html` file. This demonstrates:

- **CSS custom properties** for a consistent, themeable design system (colour palette, typography, spacing)
- **CSS Grid** for the two-column responsive layout and full-width card spans
- **Semantic HTML** with appropriate use of `<table>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, and sectioned card components
- **Visual hierarchy** — typography scale, colour-coded status badges (RAG), progress bar segments, and stat boxes communicate information density without clutter
- **Print-ready styling** approach — fixed header/footer chrome, contained card layout suitable for PDF export or screen presentation

## Who this is for

This project is a portfolio piece aimed at roles in:

- **Technology Risk Management** (1LOD / 2LOD)
- **GRC / IT Risk & Compliance**
- **Enterprise Risk Reporting**
- **Risk technology / risk tooling product roles**

It shows the ability to translate domain expertise into a polished, self-contained deliverable — without needing a developer to build it.
